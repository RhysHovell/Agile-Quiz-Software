We encountered some strange errors when compiling the same project on a different computer. The output said it was missing some jar files:
- 1. It may be necessary to add the mysqlconnector 5.1.40 JAR file to the project folder.
- 2. Additionally it may be necessary to add the JUNIT 4.12 JAR file as well.
